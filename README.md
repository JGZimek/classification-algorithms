# Classification Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of several classical classification algorithms along with utility scripts for running experiments and generating visualizations. The focus is on a minimal yet educational approach to algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors, a perceptron classifier, and a one-vs-rest strategy for handling multi-class problems. An additional script demonstrates how these implementations compare with ensemble models from scikit-learn.

## Project Structure

- **/src**: Library modules used by the example scripts.
  - **config.py**: Paths and default hyperparameters.
  - **data/**: Dataset loading utilities.
  - **models/**: Implementations of `KNNClassifier`, `Perceptron`, and `OneVsRestClassifier`.
  - **utils/**: Simple evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) and a confusion matrix helper.
  - **visualization/**: Functions for plotting results and ensuring output directories exist.
- **/scripts**: Command line scripts illustrating how to train and evaluate the models.
  - `run_knn.py` – optimize k and p for k-NN, then evaluate on the wine dataset.
  - `run_perceptron.py` – tune the learning rate of a perceptron using the banknote dataset.
  - `run_one_vs_rest.py` – apply a perceptron in a one-vs-rest setup for the wine dataset.
  - `run_ensemble.py` – compare the custom models with several scikit-learn ensemble methods.
- **/data**: Contains the raw datasets used by the scripts (e.g. `data_banknote_authentication.csv`).
- **/docs**: Output directories for figures generated by the example runs.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd classification-algorithms
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the example scripts**

   Each script can be executed directly. Results (plots and printed metrics) will be saved under `docs/`.

   ```bash
   python scripts/run_knn.py
   python scripts/run_perceptron.py
   python scripts/run_one_vs_rest.py
   python scripts/run_ensemble.py
   ```

## Usage

The scripts are meant as demonstrations of the provided algorithms. They perform typical data loading, preprocessing and evaluation steps.

- **KNN**: loads the wine dataset, splits it into training/validation/test parts, searches for the best `k` and Minkowski `p` value, then plots metrics and a t-SNE visualization.
- **Perceptron**: uses the banknote authentication dataset and sweeps the learning rate to find the best model.
- **One-vs-Rest**: wraps the perceptron for multi-class classification on the wine dataset and shows macro and micro averaged metrics.
- **Ensemble**: compares the custom models with scikit-learn random forest, bagging, gradient boosting and others.

Generated plots are stored in the corresponding `docs/task_*_results` folder.

## Documentation

### Models

- **KNNClassifier**
  - `fit(X, y)` – memorize the training data.
  - `predict(X)` – return predicted labels for new samples.
  - `optimize_k` and `optimize_p` – helper functions to evaluate different hyperparameters.
- **Perceptron**
  - `fit(X, y)` – train weights using a simple gradient update rule.
  - `predict` and `predict_proba` – produce class labels or raw scores.
  - `optimize_learning_rate` – sweep over a range of learning rates.
- **OneVsRestClassifier** – trains one binary perceptron per class and selects the class with the highest score when predicting.

### Utilities

- **Metrics**: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and confusion matrix implemented with NumPy.
- **Visualization**: plotting functions for pairplots, t-SNE embeddings, confusion matrices and basic metric tables.

## Testing

The repository currently does not include automated unit tests. Running the example scripts serves as an integration test of the modules.

## Future Extensions

- Additional algorithms such as logistic regression or SVM.
- More extensive visualizations and reporting utilities.
- Unit tests and continuous integration configuration.
